# Cifar2
SFU/CMPT419A3Q4 tune hyperparameters for training Cifar2
# 
• Build deep learning functions in Python for the CIFAR-10 dataset

• Separate the validation and training sets with 1/3 and 2/3 of the dataset

• Select SGD with momentum as the training model

• Training in hyperparameter tuning with PyTorch

• Train a predefined neural network to perform binary classification between two classes in a dataset.

• Attempts to improve the accuracy and error rate of animal image detection, so that its accuracy reaches more than 83%.
