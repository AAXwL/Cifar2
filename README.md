### Propose

SFU/CMPT419 Assignment3 Q4 tune hyperparameters for training Cifar2

### Learning Objective

* Build deep learning functions in Python for the CIFAR-10 dataset

* Separate the validation and training sets with 1/3 and 2/3 of the dataset

* Select SGD with momentum as the training model

* Train in hyperparameter tuning with PyTorch

* Train a predefined neural network to perform binary classification between two classes in a dataset.

* Attempt to improve the accuracy and error rate of animal images detection so that its accuracy will reaches more than 83%.
