# Cifar2

## Description

This document is for use in teaching the CMPT419 course at SFU. It helps students to construct deep learning functions for the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Environment(Python)

* Atorch.optim
* torch.utils.data
* torch.nn
* torch.optim.lr_scheduler
* torchvision

## Learning Objective

* Build deep learning functions in Python for the CIFAR-10 dataset.

* Separate the validation and training sets with 1/3 and 2/3 of the dataset.
* Select SGD with momentum as the training model.
* Training in hyperparameter tuning with PyTorch.
* Train a predefined neural network to perform binary classification between two classes in a dataset.
* Attempts to improve the accuracy and error rate of animal image detection so that its accuracy reaches more than 83%.
